# flask-site
This repo is for a website I'm building for a personal friend. Uploading it to showcase my skills with Flask framework.

This website is being built with Flask and will be eventually connected to a SQL database in the future (using SQLite built into Flask). For now, this is 
the website without the database. May end up adding an admin backpage in the future.
